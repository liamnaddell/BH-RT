abstract="Ray tracing and its associative techniques are mathematical functions and as such can be executed on any computational device. The question is how long is one willing to wait for the results? General-purpose processors, CPUs, with their large addressable memory space do an excellent job at ray tracing and are still the primary engine for ray tracing. Graphics processor units, GPUs, have been used, but the basic architecture of GPU isn't particularly well-suited for ray tracing, and GPUs have limited memory space. A new generation of specialized GPUs with specific ray-tracing features has been introduced and except for the memory space represents a real challenge to CPUs. Specialized, custom, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) have also been developed in an attempt to speed up the rendering time. None of them have had long-term success, and most have died still-born.",

abstract="Ray tracing has been traditionally used with applications for media and entertainment (3D animation, rendering), product development (CAD/CAM/CAE), life sciences (medical, molecular), energy, and other operations. The ray-tracing programs are used by engineers and artist proposing a project concept or new product design, by designers who bring the first renditions of the project or product for evaluation, by manufacturing people who build and test the project, or product virtually in the computer. And then when everything is proven and acceptable, marketing people use ray tracing to create images to sell the product. Ray tracing is used in all four stages from project concept to fulfillment. The concept of virtual prototyping and in the film industry pre-viz has been embraced by most industries and has saved millions of dollars by eliminating redos and expensive after-sales repairs.",

abstract = {In this paper we explore the viability of path tracing massive scenes using a "supercomputer" constructed on-the-fly from thousands of small, serverless cloud computing nodes. We present R2E2 (Really Elastic Ray Engine) a scene decomposition-based parallel renderer that rapidly acquires thousands of cloud CPU cores, loads scene geometry from a pre-built scene BVH into the aggregate memory of these nodes in parallel, and performs full path traced global illumination using an inter-node messaging service designed for communicating ray data. To balance ray tracing work across many nodes, R2E2 adopts a service-oriented design that statically replicates geometry and texture data from frequently traversed scene regions onto multiple nodes based on estimates of load, and dynamically assigns ray tracing work to lightly loaded nodes holding the required data. We port pbrt's ray-scene intersection components to the R2E2 architecture, and demonstrate that scenes with up to a terabyte of geometry and texture data (where as little as 1/250th of the scene can fit on any one node) can be path traced at 4K resolution, in tens of seconds using thousands of tiny serverless nodes on the AWS Lambda platform.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we describe the challenge of developing a web front that will give an interactive and relatively immediate result without the overhead of complex grid scheduling, in the sense of the grid’s lack of interactivity and need for certificates that users simply do not own. In particular, the local system of issuing grid certificates is somewhat limited to a narrower community compared to that which we wanted to reach in order to popularize the grid, and our desired level of service availability exceeded the use of the cluster for grid purposes. Therefore, we have developed an interactive, scalable web front and back-end animation rendering frame dispatcher to access our cluster’s rendering power with low latency, low overhead and low performance penalty added to the cost of Persistence of Vision Ray rendering. The system is designed to survive temporary or catastrophic failures such as temporary power loss, load shedding, malfunction of rendering server cluster or client hardware, whether through an automatic or a manual restart, as long as the hardware that keeps the previous work and periodically dumped state of the automata is preserved.},
