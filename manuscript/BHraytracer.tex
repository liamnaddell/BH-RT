Just putting something here as a placeholder...

Outline:
1. Abstract
2. Introduction
   * Background on the kind of black hole
    * how the differential equation under study works
3. Implementation
    * how we can model the differential equation in GSL
    * how the raytracer works.
    * Domain decomposition with MPI (Potentially some images could be larger than system ram, talk about how this is handled)
    * Parallel processing with OpenMP
4. Results
    * Some rendered images
    * Scaling results after scaling image dimensions, potentially some other scaling analysis 
      which I previously did for my presentation.
5. Related and Future work
    * This technique can be used to raytrace any kind of image under light distortion
    * Kerr metric (This was done by some other people before)
6. Summary
