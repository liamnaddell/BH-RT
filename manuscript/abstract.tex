The path a light ray takes in orbit of a simple black hole can be modeled by
the partial differential equation $u^\prime\prime - u = 3Mu^2$, which relates
the euclidean distance and azimuthal angle between the light ray and the black
hole center, to the mass of the black hole.
Using GSL and standard raytracing methods, we can trace the path of a light ray
through 3D space, and determine the interactions that light ray may develop in a 3D scene.
This comes at the cost of significant computational complexity, which is handled by decomposing
the problem with MPI, and rendering distinct rays in parallel.
